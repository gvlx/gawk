___ Testing on:
	___ make clean
	___ make distclean
	___ make maintainer-clean
	___ make release

	___ make valgrind

	___ compile with tcc
	___ compile with pcc
	___ compile with clang
	___ compile with latest releaese gcc

	___ compile 32 bit tests - clang and gcc

	___ configure --disable-lint
	___ configure --disable-nls

	___ building in a different directory from the source
	___ building doc in a different directory from the source

The simplest way of making sure that no PO file is forgotten, is to 
run the following command just before rolling a new release:

  rsync -Lrtvz translationproject.org::tp/latest/gawk/ po

Major releases:
- Rotate the ChangeLog and NEWS files.
- When doing so, update any necessary Makefile.am files to
  list the rotated ChangeLog file!

========== For Releasing ============

To upload:
	gnupload --to ftp.gnu.org:gawk gawk-Whatever.gz

For doc:
	Use the perl makeinfo to create the files.
	Use gendocs.sh and gendoc_template from gnulib.
